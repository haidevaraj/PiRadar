                                  "Turn your Pi into a flight radar station"

## My Fork

This is a fork of [ajharnak/flighttrackr](https://github.com/ajharnak/flighttrackr) with the following additions:

### New Features
- **Text-to-Speech Support** — Audio alerts via Bluetooth speaker
- Configurable speech alerts for detected aircraft
## Text-to-Speech (TTS) Feature

This fork adds audio alerts using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** with a real human Indian female voice.

### TTS Engine
- **Primary:** gTTS v2.3.1 (Google Text-to-Speech - High quality, real human voice)
  - Language: English with Indian accent (`lang='en'`, `tld='co.in'`)
  - Provides realistic female voice for flight alerts
  
- **Fallback:** Coqui TTS (High-quality offline synthesis using VITS models)

### Installation
TTS dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haidevaraj/PiRadar.git
cd PiRadar
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Configure

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
nano config.toml
```

Fill in:
- `latitude` & `longitude` (your location)
- `radius_miles` (detection range)
- OpenSky API credentials
- Bluetooth speaker volume
- Snooze hours (optional)

### 3️⃣ Run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

See flights detected on your OLED and hear voice alerts! 🎉

## 🔊 Voice Alerts

### TTS Engine Selection

PiRadar uses **Coqui TTS** for offline speech synthesis (or **gTTS** with internet):

#### Option 1: **Coqui TTS** (Recommended - Offline) ⭐

✅ Works completely offline  
✅ High quality, natural voice  
✅ No internet required after first model download  

```bash
# Already included in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 2: **gTTS** (Online)

✅ Slightly more natural voice  
⚠️ Requires internet connection  
⚠️ Slower (1-2s per announcement)  

To switch, edit `main.py`:
```python
from text_to_speech import TextToSpeech
tts = TextToSpeech(volume=100, language="en-IN")  # en-IN = Indian English
```

#### Option 3: **pyttsx3** (Fallback)

✅ Fully offline  
⚠️ More robotic voice  

Automatically used if Coqui/gTTS unavailable.

## 🎨 Display Features

### Alert Screen
When a flight is detected:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  UAL1234                       │  ← Callsign
│  Houston IAH → Denver DEN      │  ← Route
│  SPD: 450kt  HDG: 315°  ALT:35K │  ← Flight data
│  VS: 1200fpm ▲                 │  ← Vertical speed
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Idle Screen
Shows rotating airplane facts while waiting for flights.

### Snooze Indicator
Displays "SNOOZED UNTIL 7:00 AM" during quiet hours.

---

## 📊 Alert Behavior

When a new flight enters your detection radius:

1. 🔊 **Alert sound plays** (chime.mp3 or alert.mp3)
2. 📱 **OLED shows flight details**
3. 🗣️ **Voice announcement** (if enabled)
   - "Southwest Airlines SWA4389 Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport -> San Antonio International Airport. Cruising at 35,000 feet, 451 miles per hour, heading south, 15 minutes delayed."
4. 📝 **Logged to console**

**Squawk codes:**
- `7700` → Emergency (plays alert.mp3)
- `7500` → Hijack (plays alert.mp3)
- Others → Normal (plays chime.mp3)

**Cooldown:** Same callsign won't re-alert for `cooldown_minutes` (default: 15)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### OLED Not Showing

```bash
# Check I2C connection
i2cdetect -y 1
# Should show "3c"

# Check wiring: GND, VCC, SDA, SCL
# Try raising Pi I2C voltage to 5V (if display supports it)
```

### No Audio/Bluetooth Not Working

```bash
# Check speaker is paired
bluetoothctl devices

# Restart PulseAudio
pulseaudio --kill
pulseaudio --start

# Test audio
paplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

### API Errors

```bash
# Check OpenSky credentials
curl -u YOUR_ID:YOUR_SECRET "https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all"
# Should return JSON

# Check FlightAware key
curl -H "x-apikey: YOUR_KEY" "https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi/me"
```

### High CPU Usage

```bash
journalctl -u flighttrackr.service -f
```

Useful service commands:

- Start: `sudo systemctl start flighttrackr.service`
- Stop: `sudo systemctl stop flighttrackr.service`
- Restart: `sudo systemctl restart flighttrackr.service`
- Disable autostart: `sudo systemctl disable flighttrackr.service`

## Flight Aware API 
The FlightAware AeroAPI acts as an enrichment layer for your tracker. While the OpenSky API tells you where a plane is, the AeroAPI tells you who it is and where it's going.

What the FlightAware API receives and returns
In your current implementation, here is how the data exchange works:

The Input (Request): Your script sends the Callsign (e.g., UAL672) and a time window to the API.
The Output (Response): The API returns a "Flight Object" containing:
Route: Origin and Destination airport codes (e.g., KEWR to KIAH).
Aircraft Type: The specific model (e.g., B39M for a Boeing 737 MAX 9).
Live Status: Whether the flight is "On Time," "Delayed," or "Arrived."
Timestamps: Precise scheduled vs. actual departure/arrival times, which your script uses to calculate delay_minutes.
## How FlightAware usage is minimized

- FlightAware is only queried for callsigns whose prefix matches a known airline in `assets/icao_to_airline_names.json`
- Callsign lookups are cached for a short time, so the same ident is not re-fetched immediately
- Re-alerts are suppressed by `cooldown_minutes`, so the same ident does not repeatedly trigger enrichments
- Snooze hours stop normal polling during quiet times
- `monthly_call_limit` hard-stops FlightAware usage when your cap is reached

This means you can still see nearby aircraft from OpenSky without necessarily spending a FlightAware lookup on every plane overhead.

## Alert behavior

When a new flight is detected inside the configured radius, the app will:

- Play `assets/chime.mp3` for normal alerts
- Play `assets/alert.mp3` for squawk `7700` or `7500`
- Log the flight details to the console
- Show alerts and system status on the OLED when enabled
- Render a dashboard-style alert layout with a callsign header, route/type detail line, and bottom widgets for `SPD`, `HDG`, `ALT`, and `VS`
- Translate common aircraft type codes into friendlier names via `assets/aircraft_types.json`

If FlightAware is configured and the callsign looks like a known airline, the alert may also include:

- origin and destination airports
- a cleaned-up aircraft type like `CRJ-900` instead of a longer manufacturer-prefixed label

When the display is idle, it rotates airplane facts in random order without repeats until the full fact list has been shown.

## Notes

- If `pygame` cannot initialize the mixer, the app will keep running and log a warning instead of crashing.
